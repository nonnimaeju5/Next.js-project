Project for module 6 - next.js guide Deployed: 

I followed this tutorial on next.js blog : Learn Next.js https://nextjs.org/learn It was a simple yet informative tutorial on how to set up a blog page with Next.js, I now have a better understanding on how Next.js works and I really like how it works. # Next.js-blog
# Next.js-project

I had a lot of path directory proplems while trying to deploy this project, i moved the project to a new folder and made some error fixes which didn't do the trick.
The blog site works and it in my localhost:3000 it is showing fine,  but i wasn't able to create the live link with Vercel so i am turning this project in and the one who reviews won't be able to see it, hopefully youll just take my word for it:)
